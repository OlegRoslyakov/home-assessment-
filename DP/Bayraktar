In March 2020 Bayraktar TB2s, Anka-S UAVs, and an array of Koral electronic jammers were deployed and extensively used in coordinated action to strike Syrian Army targets on the ground during the Operation Spring Shield launched by Turkey following losses the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the Russian forces in northwestern Syria at the end of February 2020.[81][82][83] The deployment was assessed by experts to be a success and a tactical game-changer.[84][85][86]

During the week of fighting, Turkish drones took out 73 Syrian armed vehicles.[87] Russian sources said that the Russian-backed Syrian air defences claimed the destruction of seven Bayraktar TB2 UAVs by 5 March 2020.[88] However, there is only visual evidence for three Bayraktar drones being shot down.[89][90][91][92]

On 23 August 2020, another Bayraktar TB2 drone was shot down by Syrian Air Defenses near Kafr Nabl, Idlib after being detected spotting targets for Syrian rebels.[93][94]

On 22 October 2021, Turkey launched a surprise attack using Bayraktar TB2s on the Syrian town of Ayn al-Arab, destroying several vehicles and killing a passenger of a car, a suspected member of a Kurdish rebel group.[95]

In June 2020, the Defence Minister of Azerbaijan, Zakir Hasanov, announced that Azerbaijan had decided to purchase Bayraktar drones from Turkey.[97] During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Bayraktar TB2s were used against Armed Forces of Armenia with great success.[98] Azerbaijan used TB2s to destroy Armenian artillery, infantry positions and military vehicles, including BM-30 Smerch MLRS, T-72 tanks, BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFVs.[99][100] Nine Osa and Strela-10 air defense systems were also destroyed by Azerbaijani drones, likely TB2s.[99] On 19 October 2020, a Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by air defenses of the Armenian Army over Nagorno-Karabakh.[101][102] On 8 November 2020, another Azerbaijani Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by air defense, in southeastern Nagorno-Karabakh.[103]

Ukraine and 2022 Russian invasion

As a part of its military modernization program the Armed Forces of Ukraine purchased 12 Bayraktar TB2s in 2019.[104][105] In January 2019, Baykar signed an agreement with Ukrspetsproject, part of Ukroboronprom, on the purchase of six TB2 and 3 ground control stations worth US$69 million for the Ukrainian army.[106][107] Ukraine received the first batch of the UAVs in March 2019.[108] After successful testing of the aircraft, the Ukrainian Navy placed a separate order for six TB2s, to be delivered in 2021, according to navy officials.[109] Meanwhile, Turkish and Ukrainian officials announced the establishment of a joint venture to produce 48 additional Bayraktar TB2s in Ukraine.[110] The first batch of the Bayraktar TB2 complex was delivered to the Navy in July 2021.[111]

During a Russian military buildup in Crimea and near Ukraine's borders, a TB2 conducted a reconnaissance flight over the Donbas region on 9 April 2021. This was the first operational use of the aircraft by Ukrainian forces within an active conflict zone.[112][113] In October 2021, a TB2 drone was used for the first time in combat during the war, targeting a Russian separatist artillery position, destroying a D-30 howitzer, and halting the bombardment of Ukrainian troops near Hranitne.[114]

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, TB2 drones have been used by Ukraine's armed forces against Russian forces and equipment.[115] In January prior to the invasion, the spokesperson for the air force command Lt. Col. Yuri Ihnat confirmed that "Ukraine has approximately 20 Bayraktar drones, but we will not stop there".[116] On 2 March, Ukrainian defense minister Oleksii Reznikov announced the arrival of additional TB2 drones.[117]

According to video footage released by the armed forces, TB2 drones have successfully destroyed on different occasions a Russian command post, military vehicles including tanks, IFVs, different types of trucks, surface-to-air missile systems (including Buk and Tor), self-propelled artillery, multiple rocket launcher (MLRS), howitzers and an electronic warfare system.[115][118][119][120][121] The drone also reportedly destroyed two Russian fuel trains, patrol boats and helicopter.[122][123][124]

On 24 February, the day of invasion, the People's Militia of the Luhansk People's Republic claimed it shot down two TB2 drones near the city of Luhansk.[125] On 27 February, Ukraine's air force confirmed two strikes by TB2 on Russian convoys in the Kherson and Zhytomyr regions.[118]

The chief of Ukraine's air force Lieutenant General Mykola Oleshchuk called the UAV system "life-giving".[126] The popularity of the drone in Ukraine led to a song, "Bayraktar" being written about the drone while throwing insults at the Russian army and the invasion.[127][128][129]

Ukrainian drones appear to be equipped with anti-jamming antenna. They appear to use MAM-C glide bombs and MAM-L. Traditional search radars appear to struggle against the TB2 because of its slow speed and size, which give it a low radar cross section. One radar that was destroyed on 7 May appeared to be actively scanning just prior to being supposedly hit. Although this may be helped by reports of Russian units turning off their own radars to reduce their own detection. It also can be deployed within minutes and launched from a normal road.[130]

On 26 February 2022, two TB2 drones were claimed shot down near Schastia.[131] On 17 March 2022, a Bayraktar TB2 was shot down over Kyiv; Russia published images of the drone wreckage.[132] A second TB2 drone was shot down on 29 March 2022, in eastern Ukraine[133][134] On 2 April a third TB-2 drone was shot down.[135][136]

On 12 April 2022, one Bayraktar TB2 was claimed to be shot down by Russian frigate Admiral Essen off the coast of Crimea.[137][138]

On 13 April 2022, Ukrainian sources claimed at least two R-360 Neptune missiles were responsible for the sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva – causing an explosion on one of the ship's exposed deckside missile tubes. Drones, likely TB2s, were alleged to have helped decoy the cruiser's defences.[139][140]

On 26 and 27 April, three additional TB2 drones were destroyed, two in Kursk Oblast[141][142] and the third in Belgorod Oblast, Russia by a Pantsir-S1.[143][144]

On 1 May, a TB2 drone with registration S51T was shot down in Kursk region, Russia.[145] TB2 losses amounted to seven units confirmed visually.[123]

On 2 May, Bayraktar drones operated by Ukraine attacked and destroyed two Russian Raptor-class patrol boats near Snake Island.[123]

On 7 May, a TB2 drone attacked and destroyed a Russian Mil Mi-8 transport helicopter as it was unloading passengers on Snake Island.[124] In the same deployment, a TB2 drone destroyed a Tor missile launcher on the island, while a second launcher was destroyed as it was being unloaded from a landing craft. This cleared the way for a bombing run by Ukrainian Air Force Sukhoi Su-27 'Flanker' aircraft against buildings on the island.[121]

On 23 May 2022, the remains of a Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2, tail number 75 is found in Romanian territorial waters by Romanian authorities. The drone was likely shot down during the Snake Island attacks made by Ukraine in May 2022.[146][147]

On 28 May 2022 Lithuanian citizens fundraised $3.2 million, out of the $5.37 million, to buy a single Bayraktar TB2 drone for Ukraine.[148] On 2 June, Baykar said: "The people of Lithuania have honorably raised funds to buy a Bayraktar TB2 for Ukraine. Upon learning this, Baykar will gift a Bayraktar TB2 to Lithuania free of charge and asks those funds go to Ukraine for humanitarian aid."[149]

From the beginning of the invasion to late June, Ukraine received over 50 TB2s. On 28 June, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced that Baykar would be devoting all of its capacities to meet the needs of the Ukrainian armed forces, fulfilling its requirement for "dozens more" of the aircraft.[150]

Although at the start of the invasion Ukrainian drones, including the TB2, were able to be used to harass Russian forces, by summer 2022 they had become less effective in this role. The disorganized Russians were initially slow to set up proper air defenses, but once they did Ukrainian UAVs were downed with increasing frequency. In addition to being shot down, electronic warfare is used to jam and disrupt communication links. This may have caused the Ukrainians to scale back TB2 use.[151] On 25 July, a military expert said to the BBC, that the slow speed and medium altitudes of Bayraktar drones made them easy targets for Russian air defenses, and that many were shot down.[152]

In July 2022 Haluk Bayraktar,CEO of Baykar stated in an interview that his company would never supply Russia with its drones as he supports Ukraine's sovereignty and independence.[153] By late July a TB2 with tail number U139 was reported shot down in Belgorod Oblast, Russia.[154] Bayraktar TB2 losses reached 12 units, confirmed visually.
